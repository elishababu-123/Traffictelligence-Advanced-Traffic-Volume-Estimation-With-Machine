# Traffictelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-With-Machine
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a traffic assessment system. Traffic estimate is determined by the amount of traffic congestion. Traffic jams cause people to lose valuable time, energy and frustration every day. Congestion is a global problem that affects all levels of society.
